### Mission Statement

Mission Statement & Introduction:
In a world where digital popularity can
create an overnight sensation. We have a
society totally consumed by Clout. Some
individuals have it, some individuals
chase it and others will do whatever they
have to do to get it. Regardless at the
end of the day how does someone turn that
clout into a paycheck?!
To answer this question, Cloutform, the
brain child of Social Media Marketing
Guru Roy Robin was created. Our
revolutionary interface allows fans to
browse their favorite celebrity or brands
social media accounts all in one
convienient location. It also provides a
unique financial opportunity for a small
group of early influencers to monetize
the impressions and daily website traffic
that your social media accounts get.
Imagine being able to get paid everytime
someone watched one of your Instagram
videos or Read a Tweet you sent out, with
CloutForm that dream is now a reality.

### How It Works

How It Works:
The CloutForm Network is a fully
interactive Social Layer that helps
connect everyones favorite social media
sites into one convienient profile. Our
interface uses public API connections and
proprietary source code to create an easy
to navigate index of ALL celebrity and
major brand social media accounts. From
Nike to NY Yankees to Donald Trump, every
company, sports team and brand we all
know and love will all be on the
CloutForm platform with an account.
Users who we refer to as Clouters, create
their accounts for free via our
authentication process. Once a Social
Network of their choice is added, the
simple 3 step account creation process
begins. Typically any user can join the
CloutForm Network, start to finish, in
under 30 seconds.
Once an account is created, every user
has the ability to now design their
personal feeds. Each account has the
ability to display 4 different real time
social media feeds, which we refer to as
panels. The panels each user has the
ability to add can be there own personal
social media feed, A friends feed, or the
feed of their favorite sports team,
musician or brand.
Like most traditional social media sites
users can choose to advertise on other
popular accounts. For example, If you are
an aspiring rapper - you can look up the
cost of ad space on Kendrick Lamar's
CloutForm page. Using our simple smart
contract system, in as little as 30
seconds, any user can buy credits using
their Debit/Credit cards, create an
agreement, load the escrow wallet with
credits and have there ad go live!
With the CloutForm interface, we have
condensed all of your favorite Social
Media sites down to just one destination.
No longer do you have to download 10
different apps and max out your phone
storage in order to keep up to date.
We're one interface with every platform
integrated. Think of us as the first
Social Media Search Engine.

### What is CloutCash?

 To streamline the payment process on the
platform, we have created The CloutCash
Credit (CCC), the native currency of the
CloutForm Network, which powers all of
our advertising. It can also be used to
tip influencers who create content that
you enjoy as well as pay for a
Subscription/Live Stream on a particular
users account.
Clouters buy the advertising Credits
using their Debit/Credit cards on PayPal.
It will be a process no different than
buying an item on ebay, Amazon or any
other website we are all familiar with.
The token will not be listed on any
exchanges, nor can it be transfered out
of a users wallet. It is a 100% true
utility token, which serves only one
pupose. It's not a traditional
cryptocurrency like Bitcoin which will be
subject to price volatility, F.O.M.O,
government interference, price
manipulation, SEC Regulations, F.U.D,
etc.
By creating an ERC-20 based credit and
using the Ethereum Blockchain to validate
all transactions, we eliminate 100% of
user/brand related fraud and create a
fully trackable ledger of all of our
users transactions. If there is ever any
mixups, as the admins of the project we
can look up the problem within seconds
and get to the bottom of it.
CloutCash Credits are sent anonymously
between user accounts with little to no
transaction fees associated. These
credits, if held in your secure CloutCash
Wallet, help to increase your visibility
on the platform. In other words, if you
are a popular account and you are
building up a CloutCash balance, the
algorithm of the website will take note
of that balance and help you grow faster
by automatically placing you as "Someone
You Should Follow..." on popular pages in
your niche. When you use those credits
the algorithm removes your account and
the free website promotion stops.
In other words, if you choose to sit on
your CloutCash Credits instead of use
them right away - the system will begin
to work for you and help you grow your
account!
The steps on how you purchase the credits
will be explained when we go live. Rest
assured the process of buying CloutCash
Credits start to finish shouldn't take
any longer than a few moments and like we
stated earlier, we will be fully
integrated with PayPal.

### How Does Advertising Work?

Our proprietary algorithms use multiple
factors such as trending news stories,
social media impressions and website
traffic to determine a page's CPM value.
The process for a user to run an
advertisment on a particular page or set
of pages is as simple as Check, Send and
Activate.
First - a user visits a particular
CloutForm Account to begin the process.
In our example here we have our CEO Roy
Robin's CloutForm Account. When the user
clicks on the + Sign in the corner of the
Block Ad.
